# Eyeglass
Eyeglass is a FOSS graphical tool to compare and view differences between two images.   
The underlying heavylifting is done by the wxWidget library for cpp.   

Currently, images can be compared by alpha channel value, rgb value and hsv value, tough there aren't any plans to expand this capability.

After che comparison has terminated, the differences can be viewed in different ways.
We plan to implement a side-by-side view, a layered view and a heatmap view.

This project is a university assignment, in case someone is interested in contributing or requesting something, he/she/it (?) will have to patiently wait for us to notice, as we might be focused on something else.

Dependences:
* WxWidgets: GUI and Image comparison
* Google Test: Unit Testing
* Cmake: Compiler suite

This project uses c++11.

Ide used:
* Clion
* Geany

Others are usable, but we use these two without any conflict whatsoever.
